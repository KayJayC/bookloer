                    The Time Machine" by H.G Wells
                    <div class = "boxSpace3"></div>
                    <div class = "special">
                        It is one of the best sci-fi thriller story especially if you love to read science fiction stories. The plot centers on a time machine that can go into the past or the future. In this story, the author ventures into the future and reveals many things that he observed there. He also observed that, after millions of years, there was no longer any life on Earth. If you continue reading, you will be quite interested to learn what will happen next in this tale. This narrative does not have a satisfactory conclusion, but the middle portion of the book is fantastic and full of original ideas.

                    Under The Whispering Door by TJ Klune
                    <div class = "boxSpace3"></div>
                    <div class = "special">
                        In terms of pacing, the book is mostly a quick and easy read. I found the first half a tiny bit slow and occasionally aimless, but I think the book picks up a lot in the second half and has a much clearer sense of direction, especially heading into the end. It helps a lot that the book is often genuinely funny, which helped me get through the relatively slower parts of the book. I also enjoyed the vibrant cast of characters, and the general vibe of it is that it’s a cute and whimsical story. I appreciate that it’s heart-warming and entertaining. I’m very specifically using the word relatively here, since this is a fairly quick read overall.
